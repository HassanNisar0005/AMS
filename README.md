‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact...  
    This project was inspired by my own need to manage attendance more efficiently during my college years! It started as a small experiment and quickly grew into a fully functional system. Also, the profile pictures are randomly set if none are uploaded‚Äîso you might just find a quirky image if you skip that step!
